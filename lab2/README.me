I have chosen a maritime dataset that contains information about 418 passengers from the Titanic, including their ages, ticket classes, and family relationships aboard the ship. The main goal of this project is to solve a Classification problem by predicting whether a passenger would have survived the disaster based on these demographic and travel characteristics. The target variable I am focusing on is the survival status (traditionally labeled 'Survived'). By using this data, I want to explore how factors like socio-economic status, gender, and age influenced survival rates, allowing me to build a model that identifies the key patterns behind who was most likely to be saved during the event
